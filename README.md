<br/>

The goal of this guide is to help you prepare and practice for your next
Frontend job interview. We have curated this list of resources to keep it as
impactful as possible. The learning resources are mostly focused around
JavaScript, but the practice questions cover the entire Frontend spectrum.

This guide is targeted specifically to Frontend roles in the industry. There are
resources about JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and general Frontend knowledge. We've
also included introductory Data Structures and Algorithm questions. Not all
companies interview Frontend developers the same way -- that's why we also
created [How Companies Hire](https://github.com/Jobeir/how-companies-hire) to
give you an insight into how to prepare for the specific company you're applying
for.

When it comes to preparing for interviews there's no real secret. You have to
learn the material and practice.

## ðŸ“• Two simple steps

* [1. Learn](#learn)
* [2. Practice](#practice)

<br />
<br />

# Learn

These resources are the ideal to brush up on Frontend related topics. Before
diving into practice questions it's best to review or learn Frontend specific
material.

### JavaScript

#### [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)

You Don't Know JS is arguablly the single best resource for learning JavaScript
and how it works under the hood.

#### [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)

#### [Functional Programming in JavaScript video series ðŸŽ¥](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMUiFMZr7vk&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84)

#### [Understanding the Event Loop video ðŸŽ¥](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ)

#### [What Makes Javascript Weird and awesome video series ðŸŽ¥](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEq7Ehw-qk8)

#### [JavaScript Design patterns](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/)

Even though this book is higher level than the previous two, it's worth reading.
After reviewing the previous low level books applying that to design patterns
should bring everything together.

### JavaScript (ES6 focused)

#### [Ecmascript 6](https://www.nczonline.net/blog/tag/ecmascript-6/)

#### [Learn Ecamscript 6 interactively](https://github.com/ericdouglas/ES6-Learning)

### Data Strcutrues

#### [Itsy Bitsy Data Structures](https://github.com/thejameskyle/itsy-bitsy-data-structures)

If you're already very familiar with data structures it's worth skipping this.
_Depending on the type of Frontend job you're looking for Itsy Bitsy Data
Structures may not be completely relevant -- although, it will strengthen any
developers approach to programming._

### CSS

### [Getting started with CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started)

<br />
<br />

# Practice

This is where it all comes together. Go through as many practice problems as you
can. There's no secret to it other than time, effort, and repitition. If you
don't know an answer spend extra time understanding it.

### Practice questions ðŸ”‘

#### [Frontend Job Interview Questions](https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions)

and

#### [That JS Dude](http://www.thatjsdude.com/interview/)

#### [Frontend Job Interview Questions, including algorithms](https://github.com/khan4019/front-end-Interview-Questions)

#### [Toptal JavaScript interview questions](https://www.toptal.com/javascript/interview-questions)

### Frontend Quizzes

<a href="http://davidshariff.com/quiz/">David Shariff quiz</a>\
The Front End Web Development Quiz from David Shariff is more fun than realistic.
A lot of the questions are specific nuggets of information that are generally not
asked in real interviews. Go through this one and have some fun, but don't be too
worried about your score.

<a href="https://triplebyte.com/users/start">Triplebyte interview</a>

_TripleByte_ online quiz should only be done if you are serious about applying
to a company they partner with. Their Frontend interview process if _real_ and
can lead to a potential job offer.

### Glassdoor Questions

These questions are meant to reflect real interview questions you would get from
interviewing at Facebook or Airbnb. Try your best to solve the questions without
looking up answers. Break the problem down into small pieces and start solving
from there.
